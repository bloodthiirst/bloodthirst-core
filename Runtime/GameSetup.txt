GameSetup
-> Start

-> Setup

    -> IPreGameSetup

        - in this phase we collect all the data necessary before starting the game
        for example : loading save files , game settings , collecting all scriptableObjects

        - also big systems register in BProvider since they will be needed later on
        like GamePassInitiator and SceneLoadingManager

    -> IGameSetup (AsyncOperations)

        - in this phase we do the main loading tasks , loading scenes , maybe stuff from the internet

        - in the basic case , scene will be loadingAsync through the SceneLoadingManager
        
    -> IPostGameSetup

        - in this phase , we should have most of the scenes/content present , but not yet linked correctly
        - so what we do is register/link up everything , starting with adding stuff to BProvider
        - this is also where we plug the custom BProvider to inject EdtiorTime only dependencies if there are any
        - then we query and execute every "IGamePass" instance in order to link everything

            -> IGamePass
            happens in the following order :

                -> scene stuff
                IBeforeAllScenesInitializationPass : for now , the only thing using this is Pool instantiation
                ISceneInitializationPass : Actually initializing the scene but without referencing stuff from other scenes
                IPostSceneInitializationPass : Step where we can reference stuff from other scenes
                IAfterAllScenesIntializationPass : Step where all the scenes have already did ISceneInitializationPass and IPostSceneInitializationPass

                -> callback stuff
                ISetupSingletonPass : setup for singletons to self initialize without referencing stuff from other singletons
                IQuerySingletonPass : Step where we can reference stuff from other singletons
                IInjectPass : 
                IAwakePass 
                IPostAwakePass
                IEnablePass 
                IPostEnablePass
